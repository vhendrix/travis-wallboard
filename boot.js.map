this.people = res.json();\r\n\t *     })\r\n\t *   }\r\n\t * }\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The primary public API included in `JSONP_PROVIDERS` is the {@link Jsonp} class.\r\n\t * However, other providers required by `Jsonp` are included,\r\n\t * which may be beneficial to override in certain cases.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The providers included in `JSONP_PROVIDERS` include:\r\n\t *  * {@link Jsonp}\r\n\t *  * {@link JSONPBackend}\r\n\t *  * `BrowserJsonp` - Private factory\r\n\t *  * {@link RequestOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseRequestOptions} class\r\n\t *  * {@link ResponseOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseResponseOptions} class\r\n\t *\r\n\t * There may be cases where it makes sense to extend the base request options,\r\n\t * such as to add a search string to be appended to all URLs.\r\n\t * To accomplish this, a new provider for {@link RequestOptions} should\r\n\t * be added in the same injector as `JSONP_PROVIDERS`.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/TFug7x?p=preview))\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * import {provide} from 'angular2/core';\r\n\t * import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';\r\n\t * import {JSONP_PROVIDERS, BaseRequestOptions, RequestOptions} from 'angular2/http';\r\n\t *\r\n\t * class MyOptions extends BaseRequestOptions {\r\n\t *   search: string = 'coreTeam=true';\r\n\t * }\r\n\t *\r\n\t * bootstrap(App, [JSONP_PROVIDERS, provide(RequestOptions, {useClass: MyOptions})])\r\n\t *   .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Likewise, to use a mock backend for unit tests, the {@link JSONPBackend}\r\n\t * provider should be bound to {@link MockBackend}.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/HDqZWL?p=preview))\r\n\t *\r\n\t * ```\r\n\t * import {provide, Injector} from 'angular2/core';\r\n\t * import {JSONP_PROVIDERS, Jsonp, Response, JSONPBackend} from 'angular2/http';\r\n\t * import {MockBackend} from

provide(JSONPBackend, {useExisting: MockBackend})\r\n\t * ]);\r\n\t * var jsonp = injector.get(Jsonp);\r\n\t * var backend = injector.get(MockBackend);\r\n\t *\r\n\t * // Listen for any new

to the request\r\n\t *       connection.mockRespond(response);\r\n\t *     });\r\n\t *   });\r\n\t\r\n\t * jsonp.get('people.json').observer({\r\n\t *   next: res => {\r\n\t *     // Response came
